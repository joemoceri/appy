# Variables are declared like this

val = 5
print("The variable val is: " + val)

# You can store integers like 5 inside of them
# And also floating point values like 5.125

val = 5.125
print("Now the variable val is: " + val)

# Variables can store integers, floats, strings, bools

val = "A string inside"
print("Val becomes: " + val)

# You can also use variables in arithmetic expressions

val = 5
val = val + 3
print("Val is now: " + val)

# And also using shorthand operators

val++
print("Val is now: " + val)
val++
val/=5
print("Val is now: " + val)

# Full support for mathematical arithmetic for integer and float expressions

val = 5 * 2 + (val - 1) * (6.5/4)
print("Val is now: " + val)

# End of variable demonstration
