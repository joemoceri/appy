# As you may have seen by now, JMScript comes with a 
# built in function called print(string str)

print("This is a function call for print")

# You can use it to display items to the console

print(num)
print("Num is: " + num)
num *= 2
print("Now num is: " + num)
num -= 3.250
print("Finally num is: " + num)
