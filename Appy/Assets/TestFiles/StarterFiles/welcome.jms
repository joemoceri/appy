# JMScript is a scripting language built for the Unity player environment
# It is python-inspired, deriving most of its syntax from the language
# JMScript comes with a built-in print function
# Primitive types:
# JMInt, JMFloat, JMBool, JMString 
# Currently supported features:
# Built-in Function calls
# Loops (for)
# Conditionals (if, elif, else)
# Variable declarations
# Boolean, string and mathematical arithmetic
# Comments (Start a comment with # sign)

# In this area is where you can create scripts to run. Use the print(string str) 
# function to display answers in the console.

# Anytime you change the name of a script, a new one will be saved. You can access
# the list of all scripts using the button in the top left corner of this window.

# Note: JMScript is in a very, very early alpha stage, and therefore is unstable.
# The scripts written here are for demonstrative purposes. You can write your own
# scripts, be cautious that they may not work. Use the prewritten scripts as
# reference.
